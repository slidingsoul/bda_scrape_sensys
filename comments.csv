true but tyson is paid by paul so tyson dont aggressive,positive
btw he still badass fighter,positive
both of them won 😂,positive
"with that one-million dollar earning, tyson can live a comfortable life till he dies. if he does not buy tigers to have them as  pets.",positive
tyson didnt want to fight. i am surprised he traded money for his integrity.  he even held back some of his punches. what a shame.,positive
"for a man, winning or losing is not important, as long as you have good sportsmanship.",positive
"i am impressed tyson was able to control his fighter's spirit the entire match.deep down, he must have wanted to throw in one good ol championship punch.",positive
"well, it was not that bad actually!",positive
is this a joke. mike is like 150 years old and that dude nearly got knocked out.,positive
this is scripted because mike tyson is a monster he never stops punching this is scripted,positive
mike wins,positive
mohammed ali is real legend❤,positive
"here’s what none of you want to hear: 1. the jake paul vs. mike tyson fight wasn’t rigged—there’s no evidence to support that claim. 2. betting experts saw nothing unusual, and the fight played out exactly as expected. 3. 68% of bets were placed on tyson because he’s a legend, and fans bet on him out of nostalgia, not logic—this phenomenon is known in the industry as nostalgia betting. 4. jake paul got fewer individual bets but bigger wagers from serious bettors who understood he was the favorite to win. 5. bookmakers expect and want nostalgia betting—they profit from it. tyson losing meant most fans lost their money, and the sportsbooks cleaned up. 6. if you’re trying to claim the fight was rigged, you’d have to believe the entire global sports betting industry was in on it. 7. to rig a fight like this, every bookmaker across the world would have to know about it, suppress any signs of betting anomalies, and keep it a secret, which is impossible—too many people involved, and someone would have blown the whistle. 8. the fact is, the betting data aligns perfectly with expert predictions. 9. there’s no conspiracy. 10. the fight wasn’t rigged—it’s just how sports and betting work. stop trying to make it something it’s not. why are you being deluded? 1. social media and youtube channels profit from sensationalism. they get views, likes, and ad revenue by pushing conspiracy theories, even when there’s no evidence to back them up. 2. they prey on emotions—people don’t like seeing their heroes lose, so they feed you stories to make it seem like there’s more going on when there isn’t. 3. these channels don’t care about facts. they care about keeping you angry, entertained, and engaged, so you keep watching and clicking. meanwhile, they’re the ones making money off your outrage.",positive
tyson will always be my hero. jake paul from the weird paul family didn't do anything special. against a 58 year(!) old man. he is a peacock like his brother. well done mike. you did great!,positive
jake paul è stato un gran signore e grande rispetto per tison che ha resistito,positive
glad i didn't waste time watching the whole fight.,positive
"imagine that a little boy appears who wants to avenge tyson, like tyson for muhammad ali 🤔",positive
ludzie zapłacili aby to zobaczyć i zrobiono z nich frajerów. 😂,positive
tyson threw better punches in the hangover.,positive
"if you think you didn't missed anything, you're right",positive
he is still strong!!,positive
i like my cheese moldy,positive
the commentator already knew it was scripted 😂😂😂,positive
i feel privileged after seeing mike tyson back in the ring. hope it counts & he got big bucks for entertaining us yet again 🎉 attaboy 👍,positive

"i believed this is not a title fight with jake paul , but but mike tyson earned him a 20m dollars . not bad .",positive

the moral of this disney channel ahh movie is... 2 respect the ogs 💪🏾💯,positive
they must have planned these few moves for a highlight real because this definitely wasn't the fight everyone witnessed.,positive
abhi mike tyson.. budha ho gya yaar .. uske .. javani me boxing karta to .. tujhe boxing karne layak nahi chhod ta 😅😂,positive
mike tyson  i love you ❤ winner,positive
the fact jake paul thought it was a fair fight(mike was around 50 yr and jake is like 20 or something idk),positive
bob sapp is next in the line 😅,positive
it was all scripted😅,positive
pitiful 😂😂😂😂,positive
shortest  highlight reel ever,positive
this was rigged mike could have let go and he didn’t this is crazy but i mean still to be safe because his age i’m not mad but he might could have knocked him out but this is all a show with this jake paul guy he pays these guys to fight him and it’s a show tyson took them shots and he acted like he didn’t no how go fight probably said go head go crazy first two rounds show your stuff than we gonna play it safe let me tap yo coople times lol,positive
"mike was winning again in my opinion.  the only time mike will lose is when i see him in the floor nocked out by ko , but not until that tome . we'll done mike , you r still the king of boxing .",positive
"no evidence either way... i believe (like 99% of people) that it was rigged, but they both won financially...fair play to jake (i'm truly not a fan of his), but he's played the whole world over the past 10 years...if you believe he has fights scripted (like i believe so) then you watch said fights, and then throw a fit after the final bell.... well, then the joke is on you 😂by the way snowflakes, newsflash: scripted/rigged sports has been a thing for literally hundreds of years. it didn't start with fake paul 👍🏻 now go cry.",positive
even at his age tyson is still a savage that shouldn't be fucked with,positive
"someone please help me understand, what was the point of this fight? were they beefing or it’s  just entertainment?",positive
bank account is really winner 🏆,positive
fight a boxer your age and see who wins,positive
netflix is a joke. they are a bunch of idiots that dont know what their viewers want. obviously because someone that isnt qualified to lead is in charge,positive
"i love tyson’s boxing technique i get goosebumps watching his moves.paul has no technique he just fights like a streetfighter.huge respect for tyson who is almost 60 years old and still fighting like before, i bet jake paul is not going to even continue fighting at his 40th year😂",positive
"you are bad actor mikei do my best ok, the last time a chinese dude beat me and everyone love it",positive
i know jack was going to win🎉,positive
"this was not a rigged fight. lolthey were definitely fighting, being strategic and mike is old. why is everything a conspiracy with you internet professors. lmao",positive
still the whay tyson moves at his age is beautiful,positive
"what a shamed,, how many years the age difference again???? lol lol lol lol please tag jake paul 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣",positive
tyson🖤,positive
it's a shame 😂😂,positive
mike en su momento era indestructible. el único que lo venció fue el tiempo,positive
"hay mucha diferencia de tecnica y potencia, se ve muy superior aun tyson, pero no podia ganar , parece que era la condicion para pagarle .",positive
"the fight is fakem mike got his 20 lemons. but you can tell from uis face, his moooves he doesn't undersand what is happening, he diesnt trust himself after fight. definitely the fight is fake. but mike got big surprise first time. jake please coool down, you will get your mobey 😂 now i see tysons tiger unhappy wateing for a play :)",positive
i never watched. i knew better. can't believe how much people pay to see this though. should have did a celebrity bout like elon vs zuckerberg 🤔,positive
i've definitely come to the conclusion that the fight was a fix.so netflix could cash in and a big grand opening.and have other fights lined up,positive
"acabaram definitivamente com o esporte, ja foi o futebol, o basquetebol, o box vamos atras de mais um....😂😂😂 hoje a frase é os últimos serão os primeiros ou ao menos terão prêmio também 😂😂😂😂😂😂",positive
"jake paul is a nobody he erects his  own self-absorbed  reputation like a sponge, sucking up the creativity of those he challenges. in a social media game, not reality.",positive
"lmao wait what, he couldn't even ko an old retired man? sure, ""win""",positive
we live in a world where mayweather couldn't knock out logan paul and tyson couldn't knock out jake paul. 😲,positive
tyson is best forever.,positive
mike don't fight again,positive
pov jake paul when he sees a group of old people and retired boxer: another worthy opponent 😈,positive
paul looks like he’s afraid the tyson is going to change his mind about hanging back.,positive
i would like to thank mike tyson and jake paul for this whole comments section.,positive
"this was exactly as they promoted it, a netflix show",positive
i'm not a boxing expert but paul's gloves seem pretty low ...,positive
what's the age difference? if paul is fighting at heavyweight now i think he should fight one of the current heavyweight contenders or champ. it's only fair.,positive
won by points 😂,positive
we are foolish 😂😂 they are deal his बिज़नेस 😂😂,positive
mike should have won jake paul sucks,positive
just fun to all fans of mike iron tyson.....still you are d best fighter...,positive
tyson still wins 🎉,positive
i am torn. it looked like tyson was injured in his leg but i don't know. jake could have caused it. everyone wanted tyson to win to shut jake down but jake is young and hungry and mike is old. well we've had a white undisputed heavyweight champion for 20 years. everyone might as well get used to it.,positive
❤❤ toopppp tayson,positive
it was hilarious tyson almost weaving and diving on instinct and stopping biting the gloves going back to jakes range,positive
do you understand  what's going on ❤❤,positive
hey everybody...this is just a show ❤❤❤but not a fight......so make can take home  20 million dollars ❤,positive
mike tayson😢❤,positive
many of the comments have more than 1000 likes,positive
anyone notice jake paul doesn't even keep his gloves up to protect his face? like even amateur boxers should know.,positive
wwe is better than this.......,positive
boxing used to be cool,positive
if mike tyson was in his age then jake knockout in 1st round🤣🤣,positive
jake paul looks a lot faster . unless of course. tyson punches quicker than the camera. jake paul has been doing great.,positive
tyson selled his talent,positive
this is like a fight between a healthy men in his 20's fighting his granfather we all know would win,positive
mike tyson is 56 years old and jake is only 27 if prime tyson was going to fight jake at 27 y age tyson was goiong to win but now tyson is old and he dont fight that good now so mike tyson won the fight,positive
"jake didn't do anything that would have even hurt mike tyson, if he wasn't already in bad shape. none of jake's punches were anything, but love taps. he's got no power punches, at all. 🙄",positive
tyson is old now. he could easily beat jake if he was in his prime years,positive
atleats champ was getting a clean hits. definitely scripted,positive
mike tyson would win but he didn’t because he retired and he is to old,positive
سبحان الله وبحمده ♥️,positive
is this boxing theme from wwe? 😅,positive
that was the highlights???? ridiculouswhat a robbery from this guys. enjoy your millions.,positive
i didn't pay but i still want my money back,positive
nice script,positive
no😢,positive
ty the real legend. this good match i think.,positive
"spectacle siiii dur à regarder, pour tout fan invétéré de mikey mike 😥",positive
yo jake got the win,positive
adrian: rocky no puedes ganar tienes 60 años xd,positive
"haha, just look how mike throw punches 😂😂😂 like he dont want to hit at all, 1 legit punch and jake is out",positive
"i think his punch still strong. stronger than jake biatchy. problem is his conditioning. getting exhausted so quickly. train, focus on improving conditioning and then fight again and show us, prove us that u r still iron mike 🎉",positive
bro jake paul wins but the hand of mike tyson like where's my money jake paul,positive
bro mike tyson is old😅,positive
"hope tyson humbles himself about all that talking about beating mayweather in his current age, dude lost to a youtuber who boxes for fun😂",positive
i don't think it was riged looked more like jake paul forgave mike tyson life in the 3rd round jake connected a 3 jab combo and he could finished with a cross but you can tell how he pulled back on throwing it,positive
next i want to see a match between a 5 year old and jake paul 😂,positive
everyone who thought that tyson would win probably also thought that kamala would. god this fight was so overblown and obviously promoted as a payday for everyone involved. those that thought tyson would beat someone half his age should keep quiet next time.,positive
"but still. check out those swings on tyson, he's still number one",positive
so disgraceful when tyson put out his hand at the end to shake but jake just ignored it and focused on his god awful celebration.thank god i didn't watch it that day. saved me some good sleep,positive
"thats fake, mike tyson is the real winner.",positive
ayy okay okay,positive
tyson got the money tyson win ❤❤❤,positive
"jake maybe win the match, but mike win the people 🔥",positive
qué cosa tan más ridícula el caso es darle fama a cualquier cabrón😂😂😂,positive
if only mike could win not trynna be rude to jake but im a mike tyson person,positive
i have a lot more respect now for jake paul. i think he was the one holding back. tyson looked very tired after round 2 and i think paul didn't wana be the guy killed tyson. just my view but who knows certainly i don't.,positive
the kid can fight regardless what anyone says. i have eyes and im not a jp fan. mike just lost momentum after round 3. how did they stage tyson's legs being wobbly? tyson isnt that healthy to begin with he should have waited another 6 months to prepare but that 20 million was to lucrative to pass up. congrats mike.,positive
😂😂 jake paul is a joke son mike tyson in his prime would have sent him to the shadow realm in one uppercut 😂😂😂 gtf outa here...,positive
"just because jake paul won, that doesn’t mean that our legend is not a king because he still is, stay strong mike!",positive
genetics and athletes keep evolving over time even the ufc fighters are way more intense then they were 10 yrs ago so obviously tyson didn't stand a chance against someone half his age that has been training his whole boxing career where tyson been training for 6 months and hasn't been training before hand,positive
look.. personally i would have paid good money to see mike tyson wreck his world. because let's face it he deserves a good humbling,positive
awesome fight!,positive
wow we all know he didnt earn that he def paid off the ref,positive
"if mike tyson was younger, he had a very good chance of losing to jack.",positive
"i saw just now the highlight, and i am glad i didn't pay a penny for the circus, boring",positive
"tyson may have lost, but watching him compete hard for every round, not giving up his to age or his younger, more agile opponent, was the real win in my eyes. the discipline and dedication to train and get back to that shape, after all those decades - that’s extraordinary.as a 63 year old who still pushes himself all the time, i can relate to the physical and mental demands such a comeback requires.",positive
tyson the best!,positive
this fight was embarrassing for both parties all for payment hope that 30k lasts buddy 😂,positive
tyson won. and was fighting for less money. the passion and effort and heart came from tyson. the judge decision opinion came from who had the most money to win.,positive
je le pensais assagie à sont age triste 😥,positive
"mike : i aint gonna loose, well he was right there, when he went to the cash machine. gota give it to him, hustling was his first sport. genuinely happy for mike.....big fan",positive
these comments are killing me here 😂😅😂,positive
wow..this was a great waste of my time,positive
"now, i realize that the secret to making a million is saving for better trades. i always tell myself you don't need that new maserati or that vacation just yet. that mindset helped me make more money trading. i traded with 10k in crypto and made about $146k, but guess what? i put it all back and traded again and now i am rounding up close to a million",positive
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣power of money. this was boring. wwe anytime over this no sense,positive
insta se kon aaya h like kare,positive
atv59 fighting a younger man with alot of endurance shows how ambitious iron mike is,positive
jutuberr👌💪👏,positive
man is hawe hard raight end strong hads noo daunn❤🎉,positive
next is mecgregorr😂,positive
ok he says he has talent to win mike why don't he try with other top line contestants,positive
i bet they bribed him or some shot like mike didnt even try,positive
😂😂😂pelea de payasos fue. ya pasó tu tiempo tyson y jake bajaste tu carrera al suelo.,positive
"putting "" boxing politics "" aside, just from a plain pure boxing analysis, the age difference  and the recent fight expoaure of both fighters are the major differences in the outcome of this fight. im betting for mike from the very start but i know that paul has a high probability his gonna win. not a fair and even fight. i'll just put it this way. a mike at his prime paul will be put to sleep before the end of the first round . he is very lucky if survived and goes to the third . some may agree with me and some may not. what's your take brother?",positive
"jack paul just a dickhead,my wasted sperm 😂😂😂😂",positive
brody felt good about beating someone who didn't box for 19 years what a joke,positive
can't believe anyone knocking tyson. duy is 60. in fantastic shape. any of you to throw stones can go look in the mirror at 58. won't be close to him,positive
why would you feel happy about this win..... he can't beat someone his age so he fights someone that shouldn't even be fighting anymore.... yea that's something i'd be proud of. what a joke. the paul brothers are both gross!,positive
"i mean, tyson is pretty good for his age, reminder that he is 58",positive
i dropped out on round 1 after seeing jake running around the ring. lol,positive
lawan aki aki broo😂,positive
"he is a hero this mike tyson,, at the  age of 58 still fighting looking very strong if he was at the same age as jake paul,he would knock this man in a first round",positive
got a great 8 hours of sleep. watched this in 2.5 minutes... still felt like a waste of time.,positive
love you mike ❤️ button👇,positive
"a very costly publicity, isn’t it? i mean, tyson got the $ and paul got the 🎥🎞️. netflix got more subscribers and i leant greatest lesson of a lifetime…",positive
مهزلة قريبا جايك سيقاتل جدي...😂,positive
tyson é bom é uma lenda desse esporte mas pra mim antes não existe ninguém próx de  ali e holidield e rocky balboa 😅😅😅😅,positive
tyson is getting old. for me he is the best❤❤,positive
staged theater.. 😂😂je,positive

this match fixed mike tyson is real winner❤❤❤❤❤,positive
what's wrong bro 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,positive
it was not that bad,positive
nice sparring,positive
jimmy carter is next.😂😂😂,positive
looking at the way mike moved during training compared to this truly  proves this fight was scripted and directed,positive
white dude won as always.,positive
tyson would have won if he tried for more than 2 rounds,positive
he should call it mike firestone now. waiting for the submissives of america to color their dung and by dint of zipped-up tries to caress children 🚸 🎉,positive
wow😂,positive
mike fight for the money 👌 not for the ring.,positive
jake so proud of himself...,positive
"in the uk, you receive a letter from our king on your 100th birthday 🌬🇧. jake paul extends an invitation to the usa 🇺🇸.",positive
this fight was all rubbish.😊😊😊,positive
jake paul: sees * 108year man *jake paul again: what a worthy opponent!,positive
watching fight after know the winner from short video is very funny,positive
it feels great to be vindicated that this was all rigged what i said & basically they conned you out of your money. i told you tyson was going win & boxing is rigged when not sanctioned. you made a bunch of corporate people & these two millions they took your money. tyson was going win & what's his face is going loss. a sucker is born every minute & next time don't get conned by these. not sanctioned it's rigged & can be like a movie.,positive
mike tyson is always king ❤❤❤,positive
mike tyson always win❤,positive
i'd love to see these two fight for real.,positive
jajaja jaque mate 😂,positive
if it was not rigged jake would go find muhhamad ali,positive
would like too se jake take on anthony joshua,positive
been waiting for the highlight 💀,positive
rumour has it netflix viewers are still watching the fight 😂,positive
mike let jake win,positive
"just curious. what's mikes vo2max? i'm 67, and it's 55. i completed five ultramarathons last year. 130,000+ steps in 24 hours. i've lost some balance, and agility. but i have both mental and physical stamina.i didn't expect someone nine years younger and with so many conditioning resources, to tire like that.  my perspective and expectations are based on what i know is possible. most americans don't actually know what's possible through experience. they base their expectations on the norm, or the opinions of others who've never had to push past the age factor.i can't do better than mike in the ring. but i can do better on a treadmill or hiit routine. and i won't take a penny to prove it. i'd gladly do it for charity. mike shouldn't receive criticism from those who couldn't match his effort at 58+ years of age.",positive
biggest gimmick fight 😂,positive
"roy jones jr, sounds like george foreman.",positive
"what highlights were there? the starting bell, and the end? lol",positive

i watched it illegally and i want my money back.,positive
i want jake to challenge manny pacquiao 😂,positive

make no mistake mike didnt give his 100 percent power. he went easy on jake. as stallone said jake he spared your life. if mike would have gave everything he had he would have brutalized jake,positive
27+27 : 54and tyson is 58. still he was untouchable for first two rounds. it's only age which make him tired for rest of the round.huge respect for tyson.congratulations jake paul,positive
what a joke!.... anyway... easy money!... 🤔😁😁😁,positive
ail would be ashamed of your actions ..never dance or say his name you sell out boxer mike bittem tyson they had your life always what chain have you broken please respond please tyson!!!! challenge the public give a real fighter a chance to change there life instead of the rich man,positive
it’s crazy how tyson the baddest boxer alive let his legacy go over money!!!??? may weather may not be in tyson era but never would he take that bs and i grew up watching tyson the ladies fought harder then anyone of those paper champs,positive
good to see mike in the ring again even tho  he versing some cocky young punk.,positive
team tyson ❤😢,positive
jake’s bowing to tyson is so cringe lol. “oh i’m so humble and respectful” and he does it like three times in different ways. so cringe,positive
"jake, much respect for giving mike tyson the chance to step back into the spotlight and earn a big paycheck. after all the unforgettable moments he’s given us, he’s more than earned it.",positive
i'm glad i didn't stay up to watch the real thing if those are the highlights!,positive
"caskill, new york,  219 .5 lbs , black shorts,  black  shoes,  16 1st round,  three knockdown stopages , he took down a lotta great heavy weights , i mean if you put it  on the line, he is still motivational man. he created so much entertainment for people at a young age and he made , in a small way,  jake paul and others by just watching this guy take over, red rover , millionaires,  how many people did mr mike tyson motivate you to become a millionaire??? black shorts,  black,  shoes,  219 .5 lbs, his word on human history is the best boxer this world  has ever seen,  or will ever in the future,  anyone would not comprehend,  the most dangerous boxer ever!!!! his knockouts are scary. mike you deserve allotta credit,  you guys put on the best match on years!!!!!! it was down to one punch,  the judges got it wrong,  blessings to mike and jake and their families,  you guys did an incredible fight ever, keep up this great work,  i will inform head office about this fight, i think head office would be happy!¡❤️❤️🌎🌎🌎🌎🌎🙏🙏🙏🙏🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂blessings,  miracles,  and wonders !!! , to both families and friends,  godspeed!!  to the immaculate heart of mary ❤️ to the sacred heart of jesus,  ❤️, amen 🙏 🙌 blessings to the whole boxing world,  you guys rock and roll!!!!!",positive
"next boxing event on netflix, sylvester stallone (78) versus mike tyson (58) 🎉.",positive
they both did good.  especially  the age gap. ❤,positive
money won 😂🎉,positive
compare phones 20 years ago to now 2020s people would laugh at the 80s 90s guys and gals its just way faster way way way faster!,positive
nice choreography by mike and jake coaches. good thing they didn’t made it even practicing 6times. 😂,positive
"best,best and best.",positive
this is how you would expect an ordinary 58 year old box in the ring.  drugs and alcohol did in world champion boxer mike tyson.,positive
bro just defeated a 40 year old boxer and jumping of joy . he can't face prime mike tyson 💀💀☠️☠️,positive
that was fun! 🎉,positive
jake paul is getting stronger 💪🏽!,positive
"it was rigged from the start, the only winners are the wallets",positive
mike tyson 58 years old. with 18 strokes have 73 points againts 79 for paul. so he is very strong than paul,positive
good thing i bet my money on jake paul lmao i know its just cash grab,positive
after seeing iron mike wobble in the 3rd round i'm pretty convinced jake could have knocked him out early but that's bad for business. it would be better to elongate the fight to all the rounds. the people would get more bang for their buck and jake would benefit greatly! this was more like a tribute/honorary match for iron tyson. good job to both men. btw logan is a special kind of p.o.s. those stupid prime bottles! xd okay nvm its a spray! xd,positive
this feels like wwe.,positive
i can see a good script for rocky vlll.,positive
jake likes fighting old people,positive
"jack paul respect, he know mike the legend..",positive
this where all the courageous experts meet to share that wealth of knowledge 😂😂😂,positive
"the right hand from jake paul at the beginning (11 seconds)does not actually connect. hell of a jab from tyson at 20 seconds. if tyson did not have the perforated ulcer and the fight had taken place earlier it would certainly have been more competitive. strange things in this fight where tyson does not follow up on a good punch, same with paul.",positive
logan paul just casually being the homie tho…,positive
"""you can see jake paul land a beautiful left hook"" are we watching the same fight",positive
honestly tyson still got the stile......but u can't get away with the age,positive
im happy bc i like jake paul,positive
watching the highlight alone makes me feel i was robbed of my money... this is the gayest fight i have ever seen 😂😂,positive
"gw salut dg om tyson, masih kuat main 8 ronde, dg usia nya yg sdh termasuk kata gori kakek kakek , jake paul mah gak ada apa apa nya sama muda nya om tyson , di buat gk ada nyaww nya lg klo om tyson masih muda , good luck om tyson , sangsr memang pdhal sdh tua 😎 salam dari indonesia om!",positive
"in the uk, you receive a letter from our king on your 100th birthday 🌬🇧. jake paul extends an invitation to the usa 🇺🇸.",positive
11 years ago paul was viner. now he is fighter.,positive
some people saying about: half-life 2 alpha version demo: free tv moment in cop versus civilian fight is better than tyson/paul fight. lol.,positive
the real winners are the people who only watched the highlights instead of waiting for hours on a friday night,positive
give me jake paul & i will show him what boxing really looks like. i'm not even a boxer,positive
well mike tyson is old now,positive
in this situation i am glad to have youtube,positive
mike is going after the referee in the fight next xd,positive
"but jake held unto him quite a few times when he felt the iron hit . i guess it's just for fun anyways , cause if mike was probably just two - 4 yrs younger , it would be a different game 😅😅😅😅😅😅 wooooow . not such happy  and intriguing match because of the age gap .🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊",positive
mike tyson ♥️♥️♥️,positive
so people thinks this is real??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂,positive
"i think,🤔 jake paul has taken the help of illu*min*ati to win the fight. like many other famous people. and this whole match was scripted. his haircuts and tattoos symbolises that, he is a part of illu*min*ati (⏬). they used black ma*gic to weaken, mike tyson. [it's my opinion about it❗]",positive
a ty jsi vyhrál já jsem to viděl,positive
v1 marián kvůli tomu bude rozumět a vyhrál jsi ty a chci tě vyzvat jedna v1,positive
tyson is still my favorite,positive
"at least paul showed true respect, for the very first time...",positive
nothing short of a joke and it was exactly what we knew it to be... a stunt.,positive
i haven’t seen anyone mention that it’s still impressive for a 60 year old man to make it through an 8 round fight.,positive
mike is so kind. instead of eating jake's ear he ate his own gloves.,positive
if mike lands that first right hand it’s lights out for jake,positive
the best part of this fight was not watching it.,positive
nice . jakee paul vs mike  ai video on my  channel,positive
tyson is the best,positive
boring af. they both definitely held back. the girls fight was far more entertaining.,positive
jake paul next heavyweight champion of the world!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂,positive
what if prime mike tyson was there😅,positive
how is jake feeling after winning a fight against an old guy:,positive
if the best heavy weight champion comes back at 60 years old and holds his own in a full fight and it doesn't scream true champion to you. i don't know what it means,positive
"i don't care. i don't care!! mike tyson is 58 years old, his body is not the same, and whether it's a rigged fight or not, which i think is  rigged. mike should not have been  a part of this. he should have been honored for what he has accomplished! this match should have been a tribute to mike tyson! much love to mike! you will always be the champion to many!",positive
"no doubt tyson was not hitting him with 100% of his power. you can tell he was either pulling them or not swinging as hard as he could have. mike had $20,000,000 reasons to let paul win, and he did.",positive
mike tyson ❤❤❤😂😂🎉🎉 still awsome!!!!!,positive
thank god i didn't waste my time or money to watch this,positive
tyson definitely looked like he was holding back. im waving the bs flag! 🏴,positive
fighting an old man who's already injured and calling yourself a boxer it's like trying to make a baby feel better by giving him candy lol,positive
they knew they could make people pay for this. how come tyson didn't fight jake paul like he was fighting those bags that's all i want to know . .,positive
these comments are lit af😂😂😂😂,positive
"setingang, i see this like watching a smack dwon show which has a lot of dramas made up as if it were real😂",positive

"seems like joke paul did it again , those brothers knpw how to get peoples money in exchange of poor content.....",positive
why didnt he fight him in his prime o whait he was not planed then,positive
how come jake paul always be having clauses in his fights like tell me if you ever seen tyson throw one his patented uppercuts nope he was not allowed it was in the contract no uppercuts took away his best weapon so another flawed win for paul he seems always have things in the contract to help his best weapon and take away everybody else's only flight where it was fair was tommy fury which mind you he lost come on jake make it make sense,positive

tyson is old and  obese and out of shape that is why  tyron lost.,negative

no sale como agarra mike tayson  respira le salvo la pelea el albitro jake paul lo agarro como 3 veces pa respírar,negative
"just reminds me of those old circus bear fights where they'd have someone fight a trained bear, and you just know it any moment that bear could murder that guy, but it doesn't because it's trained",negative
"fake fixed fight, paul was exhausted tyson was like ""i'm still ready""",negative
we need real fight,negative
if prime mike tyson fought jake paul 😳,negative
"it was rigged mike tyson was paid to lose, tyson would've killed jake paul. jake is a fake and wouldn't last in a real fight that wasn't paid off",negative
i thought i was gonna see a real fight not a paid match,negative
bro mike was barley tired and if logan fought prime mike he would have been cooked,negative
age 58 vs 26 it’s insane to make fool 😂,negative
fight was on netflix ..tells you all you need to know,negative
it's no real all this it's only for the money,negative
paul duck u fight your grandfather.,negative
how much did they pay mike to throw this fight?,negative
the first punch he threw was vicious tho,negative
"islam vs christ boxing battle legend, next jake paul vs khabib please ufc, release it!",negative
the first 2 punches that tyson threw and stopped 1 cm from pauls face were enough to tell you the whole story.,negative
0x12f4655230cdfb7de541b392d269bad7889fd5eb 😢,negative
"it is clear that tyson won the fight. paul knew well who he was facing and preferred distance. he shot when he could some deadly blows that mike mostly dodged with no problem. tyson's waist movement is brutal. i challenge him at all times, even with my eyes when the bell rang. paul a coward, he was afraid, he didn't come close, he was afraid of being humiliated.",negative
"saddest fight ever. i don't give a f*ck if mike got easy money because i'm still broke and also got let down. i don't get why people are like ""i know it was staged glad that mike made some dollars to retire"" f*ck no. the biggest boxer alive doesn't value boxing as a sport. he is another boxer that betrayed boxing. never thought i'd see him become this.",negative
if these are the highlights i dont even wanna know how boring the fight wasi am gonna watch a rico verhoeven fight which is the opposite of this crap,negative
bro was losing to a man who is 30 years older than him mike is the goat,negative
mikes training is not helping defend the rumors of this fight being rigged,negative
they should pay me for watching this,negative
the boxing commission needs to investigate 🔬 this fight cause it was a setup.,negative
"it's not tyson without the uppercuts. it was a pay off the bills and keep the creditors at bay fight. jake leads with his jaw. how could tyson not put him away? it had to be the age thing. jake's longer reach isn't new to mike. mike took the beating and took the money. seriously, i can't remember mike throwing any light's out punches.",negative
tyson’s and jake are sell outs rigging fights they should be banned from boxing 🥊 for life.,negative
i grew up as tyson my favorite boxer he attacks. this fight was so rigged. also i’m finding out late that jake paul’s parents and mike are very close that jake grew up around mike and mike would come over for dinner parties straight up rigged. mike you let us down and lost me a lot of money.,negative
rigged fight i’ll never bet boxing 🥊 again there was a couple times mike could’ve knocked him out and there waisting time acting dumb.,negative
i thought jake paul knocked out mike:( and i was sad,negative
why mike tyson 😢😢😢,negative
biggest upset in boxing history,negative
this is pathetic,negative
disgrace,negative
i didn't watch this.was it that bad??,negative
that cheap shot by jake was insane,negative
bro really fought each over for clout bro is fighting and old man here but i mean he is mike but it’s so unfair becuase mike has been through a lot and probably got like really weak since he is now nearly 60 wich is honestly crazy in my opinion,negative
"pathetic joke, absolute disrespect to boxing.",negative
"i knew tyson was losing because i am turning into a senior citizen in a couple of days.  on some days i am stronger and faster than the 28 year olds in my gym.  but, as soon as they resist me, my body turns into an earthquake.  it's the resistance threshold that gets lost with age.  the big tree just can't handle the hurricanes anymore.",negative
"okay guys we all know it was rigged, right?",negative
tyson looks old.people just get tired as they age.,negative
coward jake paul i challenge you to lose me if you can. i know jake paul you coward you don't have the guts to fight me.,negative

imagine my surprise when a jew whos known for scams and rigging events rigs an event.,negative
rigged,negative
why can't i find the whole fight with out cut out,negative
if you watch tyson training videos for this fight that was not the same tyson we are looking at here. he could have knocked jake out in the first round but after they locked up and tyson gave him the pat on the back his whole demeanor changed. i called bs real rigged fight,negative
i kinda feel bad that tyson fought a dushbag like him,negative
this fight is scripted,negative
"whats the point, the legend is getting old hes missing the hits",negative
i lost all respect for mike tyson for purposing losing he conned his fans lied to them,negative
mike is old 😢😢😢,negative
more like fight lowlights,negative

"we should just stop the internet and capitalism and go back in our caves. everywhere you look in modern world you see ads,  marketing campaigns, big words. but on the inside what they sell to you is broken, not working, overpriced, bad quality. a scam basically. just like this fight.",negative

what jake paul was fighting 👴,negative
i like my fights scripted bruh 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥,negative

sadly boxing is cooked as a sport. what jake paul did is an absolute scumbag move. he and his brother are con artists. i hope the younger generations stop watching these two knobs.,negative
this fight was most likely rigged,negative
i’m having arthritis and pain at 58 so your great mike and most of all you got millions at this fight at 58!,negative
tyson was paid to lose,negative
"who ever sa sanctioned this fight should be fired!   jake paul taking on a nearly 60 year old man, it should have never taken place! what a scam, everyone knew mike wouldn't do well, but still, you could see paul was staying his distance throwing jabs and actually afraid to mix it up. it was obvious there would be no knockouts by either! maybe mike will finally realize he's not the fighter he was 100 years ago!! paul however should be ashamed of himself fighting an old man of 58! the whole fight was a joke, not even interesting!!😐🤨",negative
for ones who know espn purposely dont want you to see round 1 specifically at the 20 seconds of the first round mike hit jake paul with a overextended right hook knocked him out and held him up but now no one has footage of round 1,negative
🥱 blah blah..,negative
mike tyson lost his status after this fight. he is just a money fighter.,negative
fake... greatest trick the devil ever pulled!...watch tyson's pre fight training videos.,negative
"imagine fighting tyson in his prime, 50 x the speed and power. truly terrifying.",negative
"tyson, as if he was on sedatives, this fight is fake",negative
you can see in round three when jake paul staggers mike tyson and goes in for another punch and pulls back. i wanted tyson to win i really did but jake paul almost knocked him out in the third round and purposefully pulled back and stopped. he also didn't come at him as aggressively after that.,negative
"and the real winner....netflix!! millions of people to bought into the story line we were going to see the dapper dan mike tyson circa robin gibons mike tyson. didnt expect for him to prop up this clown like he did, pulling punches and letting him keep this fictional tale of this guy being a boxer.  millions more than likely subscribed just to watch it and millions will forget to cancel or update to premium service.",negative
shame on jake,negative
this was a sad thing to watch 😢,negative
mike tyson is no joke in the ring !!!!! 💯💪🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊👀,negative
27 yr old vs 58 yr old? come on! that's no match.,negative
paul is ranked 127 on the world rankings list. he will never fight a top 20 opponent. he is the poster child for this generation...all internet bs and no real substance.,negative

"jake paul such a fraud acting like none of the punches hurt him lol you kidding me tyson landed that job jake paul basically got pushed back halfway across the ring with pain in his face! mike tyson completely pulling his punches and the fact that his knee basically gave out because he's an ""old man""!!!! let's be real the fact that mike tyson is literally still standing shows that mike tyson won this fight 100% you telling me a young guy like jake paul still couldn't take out an old retired boxer!? mike tyson won this fight hands down!",negative
"just to keep it simple. will never watch jp in anything else, unless he fights someone who is a real contender in his age group. this includes any social media posts, commercials, movies, music videos, etc. i have no interest in anything else with that dude. mike in his prime would’ve put him to sleep like everybody else. that’s the truth. so, unless he fights jon jones, then he can sit down and stfu. on mike tyson, let’s not pretend this is some saint. he did it for a pay day and nothing else. he’s not donating all the proceeds to charity. he embarr-a$$ed himself.  i will not waste my time watching him in the ring again. maybe, if he pops up on a podcast here or there, i might listen. go retire in bermuda, to both of these fvcks. you made the sport of boxing look bad. ali would be ashamed.",negative
this is scripted. mike would never lose to jake paul dawg. this is rigged,negative

how can be this scripted😢,negative
"the biggest scam in boxe history, of course if... we can call this garbage boxe! a legend that retired centuries ago around 60, against a youtuber in his 30s!",negative

why is it boring,negative
bro if we are being real prime mike will kill jake,negative
this is the first fight in history to have no highlights**,negative
this fight is pathetic and shows a real lack of respect for older people and old  athletes. making money and fame on someone's age is almost like making money off of someone's disability.,negative
fake fame fake its scripted jake paul paid mike tyson to lose agaisnt him,negative
why did paul stop the fight by saluting tyson this had to be rigged up tyson was still ready to fight 😊,negative
disgusting encounter all a farce 😅,negative
feels like beating up a grandpa but like your grandpa is a boxing legend ultimate disrespect,negative
there were no highlights,negative

"jake: next, i'll fight alius: he's dead. jake: ....wake him up.",negative
mike is 60 years old...american ppl have no morals..ur beating on a old man trying to prove ur tough,negative
the first few seconds you see the fear of jake,negative
at that age you can train your strength and improve bodyweight but your reflection can never be improved,negative
"tyson, a estas alturas q piense quizás gimnasios de box, películas....pero ya no en pelear.....hay q ser realista , está bien q mantengas tu físico ..por salud más q para competir....",negative
bro why will u fight a man over 55,negative
are you kidding me? the first 3 rounds of mike fought like that the whole fight he would’ve killed jake. it’s obvious it was a finesse for a payday. at some point jake whispers in his ear relax if u wanna get paid… i truly believe that.,negative
he's gonna dig up ali for his next fight,negative
look two people hitting something stupid.,negative
"i wouldn't even pay for the ones who are supposedly at their peak in modern day boxing,let alone this!",negative
"this fight was a joke, jake you are a joke, fight someone under 35 who is an actual boxer in their prime.",negative
i think jake paul fights old people on purpose so when their dementia kicks in during the fight he wins,negative
psh smh 🤦.,negative
jake planning to fight joe biden next,negative
prime mike tyson would have won this fight. embarassing for jake paul. fighting an elderly man just for the sake of clout and money. this generation 😞.,negative

"mike's is the legend. at 58 years old, he still can fight on similar stage with jake's  in best years of his life. jake's haven't any chance if he will fight 30 years later, with the same skills...",negative

"jake paul is no world-class boxer. but he is a world-class bs artist. he is a pro at getting suckers to part with their money, that is for sure. i guess the suckers in the world are that desperate for entertainment.",negative
i think the girls before the fight deserve the credit. i was up till 12 at night to watch the fight and it was a huge waste of my time.,negative
a 27 year old beating on a 58 year old is crazy work.,negative
i want to see round 2 of this fight.,negative
mike only lost because of age,negative
i want to file charges for money laundering because the fight was so horrible.,negative
paul is ridiculous as a 27 y old he can't beat 58 y old tyson,negative
"a 58 year old is still 58 years old, even if you are mike tyson. this was not fair.",negative
you know what i think. i think mike tyson lost the will to fight at one point. he wasn't mentally in it. his mind was probably speaking to him constantly telling him done. this isn't for you anymore. you thought it was but it isn't. everyone expect the young you and you not. you are old. your time is passed. stop fighting and just get the bag and move on.,negative
you people are real simpletons if you think a fight between a 58 guy who was knocked down in half his fights and a youtube guy was going to be exciting are idiots.,negative
mike is the same dude that advocate his love for boxing yet waste everything he advocate for this rigged fight. idc what people think but i lose all respect for mike. from legend to a sellout,negative
is anything real in the media anymore. man if this was rigged makes you wonder how many other sports are rigged.,negative
i will fight jake paul when he was 57,negative
he would have killed paul but he doesn't want to kill him cuz he's old and doesn't probably want to kill when he's old,negative
no it cant be no😭😭😭,negative
jake was scared.. thats what i saw. after jake got that first hit. .. jake was all about catch me if you can old man.. scary old man.,negative
"it's so short, we could watch this fight in a gif",negative
"i look mikes leg moving, i look jake's and i wonder how this fight ever happened.",negative
"lame af. told everyone don't believe the hype. all about the money and nothing else and to be honest probably a distraction. even logan paul vs floyd mayweather you can hear logan say ""stop hitting me so hard it is an exhibition"" and look how lame and weak alot of  those punches are. i will still be standing no problem.",negative
if you paid money to watch jake paul play rockem sockem boppers with an elderly man....congratulations. you got scammed. you are the sucker that was born last minute.,negative
dont know why but i think … in this match the real mike tyson didn’t play…. its not the  mike tyson i have heard since my childood ….. really missed his fierce and speedy match,negative
